# NeuralMesh-Pi-Network

The NeuralMesh-Pi-Network repository is a comprehensive resource for developers interested in building the next-generation Pi network. The repository includes detailed documentation, source code, and tools for building and deploying the NeuralMesh Pi network.

# *NeuralMesh-Pi-Network* : NeuralMesh-Pi-Network is a machine learning project that uses a neural network to generate 3D meshes for 3D printing. The project is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, making it accessible and affordable for hobbyists and educators.

# Overview

NeuralMesh-Pi-Network uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate 3D meshes from 2D images. The network is trained on a dataset of 2D images and corresponding 3D meshes. Once trained, the network can generate 3D meshes for new 2D images.

The project includes a Raspberry Pi image with the neural network and supporting software pre-installed. The image can be written to an SD card and used to boot the Raspberry Pi. Once booted, the user can use a web interface to upload 2D images and generate 3D meshes.

# Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB or 8GB recommended)
- SD card (32GB or larger recommended)
- Power supply
- Monitor, keyboard, and mouse (for initial setup)
- 3D printer (for generating physical objects from the 3D meshes)

# Installation

Download the NeuralMesh-Pi-Network image from the GitHub repository.
Write the image to an SD card using a tool such as Etcher.
Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it on.
Wait for the system to boot and the web interface to load.
Use the web interface to upload 2D images and generate 3D meshes.
Usage

Open a web browser and navigate to the NeuralMesh-Pi-Network web interface.
Click the "Choose File" button and select a 2D image.
Click the "Generate Mesh" button to generate a 3D mesh.
Download the 3D mesh as an STL file.
Use a 3D printer to print the object.

# Usage

Open a web browser and navigate to the NeuralMesh-Pi-Network web interface.
Click the "Choose File" button and select a 2D image.
Click the "Generate Mesh" button to generate a 3D mesh.
Download the 3D mesh as an STL file.
Use a 3D printer to print the object.
Training

The neural network can be trained on a larger dataset of 2D images and corresponding 3D meshes. The training process can be run on a more powerful computer and the trained model can be transferred to the Raspberry Pi.

Collect a dataset of 2D images and corresponding 3D meshes.
Preprocess the dataset and split it into training, validation, and test sets.
Train the neural network on the training set.
Evaluate the neural network on the validation set.
Save the trained model.
Transfer the trained model to the Raspberry Pi.

This package uses Flask and Factory Boy to provide a web interface for uploading images and generating 3D meshes. It also uses pytest for testing.

## Here's a simple example of how to use the package:

```python
1. from neuralmesh_pi_network import create_app
2. 
3. app = create_app()
4. 
5. if __name__ == "__main__":
6.    app.run(debug=True)
```
In this example, create_app is a function that initializes the Flask application and Factory Boy factory. The application is then run in debug mode.

## To test the package, you can use pytest:

```bash 
1. $ pytest neuralmesh_pi_network
```

This command will run all the tests in the neuralmesh_pi_network package.

Note: You will need to install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash 
1. $ pip install pytest flask factory-boy pytest-flask pytest-factoryboy
```

## To train the neural network on a new dataset, you can use the following code:

```python
1. from neuralmesh_pi_network import train_model
2. 
3. # Assuming 'dataset' is a preprocessed dataset and 'output_model_path' is the path to save the trained model
4. model = train_model(dataset, output_model_path)
```

This function will train the neural network on the given dataset and save the trained model to the specified output path.
